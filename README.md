```

### Adjust AI Temperature

Modify the LLM configuration:

```python
llm = LLM(

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] --> B[Flask Backend]
    B --> C[LinkedIn Writer Agent]
    C --> D[Content Editor Agent]
    D --> E[Generated Post]
    E --> F[Display in UI]
    F --> G[Copy to Clipboard]
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User enters topic** via web interface
2. **Flask receives request** and passes to CrewAI
3. **Writer Agent** creates initial post draft
4. **Editor Agent** polishes and optimizes
5. **Result returned** to frontend
6. **UI displays** formatted post with statistics
